# CA Baseline Location Profile
This Location profile sets minimum expectations for the Location resource to record, search and fetch details and position information for a physical place where services are provided.

This profile defines localization concepts for use in a Canadian context.

## Mandatory Data Elements
All elements or attributes defined in FHIR have cardinality as part of their definition - a minimum number of required appearances and a maximum number.

Most elements in FHIR specification have a minimum cardinality of 0, which means that they may be missing from a resource when it is exchanged between systems.

In this Canadian Baseline Location Profile all elements are optional, i.e., there is no element with a minimum cardinality of 1. However, some optional elements (e.g., identifier) have required components that MUST be present if that optional element is provided.
