This implementation guide defines a number of FHIR Profiles, ValueSets and CodeSets for Canadian Use and uses others from the base FHIR Specification directly without modification.

### <a href="artifacts.html">Canadian Artifacts</a>
### <a href="vitalsigns-profiles.html">Vital Signs Profiles</a>

Each profile defines the minimum mandatory elements, extensions and terminology requirements that MUST be present. For each profile, requirements and guidance are given in a simple narrative summary. A formal hierarchical table that presents a logical view of the content in both a differential and snapshot view is also provided along with references to appropriate terminologies and examples.

### Status

The content of this release has not yet been balloted through HL7 Canada but each of the profiles have gone through [various levels of review](developmentprocess.html#review-process) by the Canadian FHIR community.

All artifacts in this specification are assigned a “Maturity Level”, known as FMM (after the well known CMM grades). The FMM level can be used by implementers to judge how advanced - and therefore stable - an artifact is.
