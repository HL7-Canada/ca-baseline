Since Modifier Extensions should have extreme caution in their application and are further nuanced by the use cases in the implementing registry systems, this extension has been shifted back to a regular extension to align to use in existing implementations. Implementers who are considering using this extension in their guidance are required to review the [FHIR Guidance on Modifier Extensions])(https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility.html#modifierExtension) before including this extension in their profile. Implementers should also be aware of the Practitioner.deceased[x] R5 concept and that the CA Baseline is monitoring changes in the element to determine if the approach to this extension requires a shift.",
