For immunization retireval, a Trade name is optional, but a Generic code has to be returned if it's known to the server or if it can be derived from the Tradename code. Supply of codings is preferred, however legacy, emergency vaccines, and recall use cases may present challenges to requiring codings. It is at the discretion of the implementer to strengthen the requirement further based on their needs and business context (e.g., requiring coding on all immunization records in their repository)."

Another example: if in 2020, a 55 y.o. patient recalls that they were immunized at the age of 5, occurrenceDateTime will have a partial date '1970' with 'estimated'=true.",

Although partial dates are allowed, an adult patient might not be able to recall the year a childhood immunization was given. An exact date is always preferable, but the use of the String data type is acceptable when an exact date is not known. A small number of vaccines (e.g. live oral typhoid vaccine) are given as a series of patient self-administered dose over a span of time. In cases like this, often, only the first dose (typically a provider supervised dose) is recorded with the occurrence indicating the date/time of the first dose.",
